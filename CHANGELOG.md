# Changelog

All notable changes to review-agent are tracked here. Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-04-23

Patch release from a one-click-install audit. Closes gaps that would cause a
fresh hermes+Lark user to hit silent degradation or post-install busywork.

### Fixed

- **`SKILL.md` version + author**: was `version: 0.2.0` (stale) and `author: jimmy` (personal info). Bumped to `1.1.1` and removed author field.
- **PDF / image / audio hard-fail**: `ingest.py` used to return a placeholder string `"[PDF ingest unavailable …]"` when `pdftotext`/`pdfminer.six` were both missing, and `scan.py` would then run the full four-pillar review on that placeholder text — producing confident-looking but garbage findings. Now raises a structured `IngestError`, writes `ingest_failed.json`, and exits 3 with a clear Requester-facing message ("让 Admin 装一下 / 你直接贴正文也行"). Same pattern for `tesseract` (OCR) and `whisper` (audio).
- **`start-review.sh` propagates ingest failure**: was swallowing the exit code (`>/dev/null 2>&1 || echo fallback`). Now detects exit 3, relays the user message to Lark, marks session `status: ingest_failed`, clears `active_session.json`, and skips `confirm-topic`/scan entirely.
- **`check_prereqs.sh` escalated PDF tools to blocker**: was a warning. Since SOP v2 routes any PDF straight to ingest and ingest now hard-fails, missing PDF tools would be a first-review crash. Now blocks install unless `pdftotext` OR `pdfminer.six` is available. `tesseract` and `whisper` remain warnings (Requester gets a "paste text" prompt instead of a hard fail for images/audio).

### Added

- **Post-install interactive prompts** in `install.sh` Phase B:
  1. "Restart hermes gateway now? [Y/n]" — runs `hermes gateway restart` or the `systemctl --user restart hermes-gateway` equivalent on Linux.
  2. "Add your first Requester now? [y/N]" — interactive wizard that calls `add-requester.sh --approve-pairing` with the given open_id + name.
  Both prompts are skipped when `--admin-open-id` is passed on the CLI (implied non-interactive mode).
- **`install/check_lark_scopes.py`** — queries Lark Open API with `FEISHU_APP_ID`/`SECRET` from `~/.hermes/.env`, probes each required scope (`im:message`, `im:message:send_as_bot`, `docx:document`, `drive:file`, `drive:drive`) and reports per-scope PRESENT/MISSING/UNKNOWN. Non-blocking — granting scopes is a human step in the Lark developer console. Wired into `install.sh` Phase B.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-22

### Changed

- **LLM model follows hermes main agent** instead of hard-pinning `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`. All LLM-calling scripts now resolve the model from `~/.hermes/config.yaml` → `model.default` and map hermes-style ids to OpenRouter format (strip `-YYYYMMDD` date suffix, convert trailing `-N-N` to `-N.N`, add provider prefix). Precedence: `REVIEW_AGENT_MODEL` env var > hermes config > fallback `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6`.
- New shared helper `skill/scripts/_model.py` exposes `get_main_agent_model()`.
- `--model` CLI flag on each script now defaults to `None` (resolve at call time) instead of a hardcoded string. Pass `--model <id>` to override per-call.
- Removed `model:` pin from `skill/SKILL.md` frontmatter.
- **Installer split into two phases**: Phase A installs files (always runs, reversible), Phase B configures Admin/Responder + patches `config.yaml` + installs MEMORY.md SOP (opt-in via prompt or `--enable-only`). Run with `--install-only` to stage files without activating.
- **Responder profile default**: `boss_profile.md` template rewritten as a functional senior-reviewer default — reviews now work out of the box without editing, though personalizing still improves quality. Old version was all placeholders and produced degraded reviews when unedited.

### Added

- `skill/scripts/check-profile.py` — scans a profile for leftover `<e.g., …>` / `<your …>` placeholders. Invoked by `install.sh` Phase B (user-facing warning) and `new-session.sh` (stderr log only, never blocks).
- `~/.review-agent/enabled.json` stamp written after Phase B for install/enable-state detection.
- **`docs/HERMES_FEISHU_HARDENING.md`** — three-layer hardening guide for multi-user Lark deployments: allowlist env, `unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair` config (note the key-based vs value-based fallback quirk in hermes), and a local hermes patch for admin-notify on pairing.
- **`install/hermes_patches/admin_notify_patch.py`** — idempotent, marker-guarded patcher for `gateway/run.py`. Inserts a best-effort hook that DMs each `FEISHU_ADMIN_USERS` open_id whenever an unauthorized user triggers pairing. Supports `--dry-run` and `--revert`. Safe to re-run after `hermes update` overwrites the upstream file.
- Troubleshooting entries in `INSTALL.md` and `docs/VPS_SETUP.md` for: stale gateway PID file, silent drop of unauthorized DMs when allowlist is non-empty, fail2ban dropping SSH on rapid reconnects.
- **Passive update check** — `skill/VERSION` file + `skill/scripts/check-updates.py` compares against GitHub (releases API with tags fallback, 24h cache, 5s timeout, fails open). Surfaces in two Admin-facing touchpoints: dashboard web banner (orange, links to release notes) and `dashboard-web.sh` stdout on launch. Silent when up-to-date or offline. User can disable with `check-updates.py --disable`.

### Fixed

- **PDF / attachment dialog removed** (reported 2026-04-22): when a Requester sent a PDF, the main agent would reply "收到 PDF 文件 📄 你想怎么处理？…" and list options. SOP now has an explicit hard rule: any attachment from a Requester = immediate `review-cmd.sh start`, no dialogue. Size guardrails added (>20 MB PDF or >100 pages → ask for smaller version; >10 MB image; >50 MB / >30 min audio). ingest.py already handles PDF/image/audio extraction inside the session, so the main agent should never run `pdftotext` / `pdfminer` / `whisper` itself.
- **`💻 terminal:` tool-call previews leaking into Lark** (reported 2026-04-22): broadened `patch_hermes_config.py` with defensive OFF values for `show_tool_calls`, `show_tool_results`, `show_code_blocks`, `show_bash` (unknown keys are harmless on hermes versions that ignore them). SOP also gained an explicit "progress messages" protocol: one short "处理中…" message while ingest/scan run; never relay tool previews, stderr, or tracebacks.
- **SOP bumped to v2** with auto-upgrade: `patch_memory_sop.py` now detects an older-version install and replaces the block in place (preserving everything after the `§` separator), instead of refusing to run because the v1 marker exists.
- **`feishu.unauthorized_dm_behavior: pair`** now seeded by `patch_hermes_config.py` on fresh installs (only if absent — respects explicit user choice) so the Layer 2 hardening from HERMES_FEISHU_HARDENING.md is the default rather than opt-in.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-22

First public release. Complete end-to-end pipeline for async pre-meeting review coaching via Lark IM + Lark Doc, with a local admin dashboard.

### Architecture

- **Three-role model**: Admin / Responder / Requester. Default install folds Admin+Responder into one user; multi-Responder is on the v1.x roadmap.
- **Per-subtask isolation**: `~/.review-agent/users/<open_id>/sessions/<id>/` each with frozen copies of `admin_style.md` + per-Responder `profile.md` + shared `review_rules.md`.
- **Runtime**: hermes (native Lark gateway) + OpenRouter (Sonnet 4.6 default) for LLM calls. No hermes fork or private API needed.

### Review framework

- **Core principle**: agent is a challenger, not a summarizer. Points out problems, asks questions, never writes answers for the Requester.
- **Six challenge dimensions**: data integrity / logical consistency / plan feasibility / stakeholders / risk assessment / ROI clarity.
- **Four pillars** (replaces earlier 7-axis model; legacy axis-based annotations are backward-compat mapped):
  - Background · Materials · Framework · **Intent (CSW gate)**
- **Responder Simulation top layer**: LLM role-plays the Responder using their profile.md and produces top-5 questions in their voice.

### Pipeline (6 stages)

INTAKE → SUBJECT CONFIRMATION → FOUR-PILLAR SCAN + RESPONDER SIMULATION → Q&A LOOP → DOCUMENT MERGE (conditional) → FINAL GATE + CLOSE + FORWARD.

### User-facing features

- **IM-based Q&A loop** with shortcut replies: `a` / `b` / `c` / `p` (pass) / `custom` / free text, auto-scoped to top-3 BLOCKER findings with remainder deferred for later.
- **Lark Doc publishing**: material + findings go into an auto-created Lark docx with inline agent callouts (content-injection style; Lark Open API doesn't expose true inline comment anchoring), shared to Requester (edit) and Responder (view).
- **Decision-ready summary**: LLM synthesizes a 6-section brief (议题摘要 / 核心数据 / 团队自检结果 / 待决策事项 / 建议时间分配 / 风险提示) delivered to both parties on close. Audit-trail version saved separately.
- **Local dashboard**: `http://127.0.0.1:8765`, read-only view of all users, active sessions, findings progress.

### Engineering hardening

- **Session isolation guardrails**: MEMORY.md SOP forbids main agent from reading session files; scripts run as isolated Python processes; stderr shrunk to minimal lifecycle markers.
- **IM outbound hygiene**: hermes config patched to stop `tool_progress` from leaking into Lark DMs (feishu platform tier = MINIMAL).
- **Lenient JSON parser**: handles LLM output with unescaped newlines, inner quotes, trailing commas, markdown fences, line comments.
- **Idempotent install**: marker-guarded SOP append, backup-on-patch, re-run safe.

### Tooling

- **One-command install** for pre-configured hermes + **bootstrap.sh** for bare-metal/VPS (auto-detects OS across Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/Arch/Alpine/macOS).
- **check_prereqs.sh** with OS-specific install hints for each missing dep.
- **sync-to-hermes.sh** for dev → skill copy iteration.

### Known limitations

- Session context isolation at main-agent layer is documentation-enforced only; see [OPEN_ISSUES.md I-001](OPEN_ISSUES.md) for hardening path.
- Lark API does not support programmatic inline comment anchoring on docx; worked around via content injection.
- Single-Responder v0 scope; multi-Responder deferred to v1.x.
- `more` / `deepen` follow-up commands from Responder on the delivered summary are documented in output but backend routing not yet implemented.
